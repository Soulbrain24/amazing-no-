<p>The Unadulterated Cat is becoming an endangered species as more and more of us settle for those boring mass-produced cats the ad-men sell us
- the pussies that purr into their gold-plated food bowls on the telly. But the Campaign for Real Cats sets out to change all that by helping
us to recognise a true, unadulterated cat when we see one, For example: real cats have ears that look like they've been trimmed with pinking
shears; real cats never wear flea collars…or appear on Christmas cards…or chase anything with a bell in it; real cats do eat quiche. And
giblets. And butter. And anything else left on the table. if they think they can get away with it. Real cats can hear a fridge door opening
two rooms away…</p>
